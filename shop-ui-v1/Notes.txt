steps while using state management lib
---------------------------------------


step-1 : know your UI appl's state/data/model

e.g shop-ui

        -> items
        -> reviews
        -> cart
        -> current-user
        -> loading-status
        -> error
        .......

step-2 : identify sync | async action which cause state change

        LOAD_ITEMS

        LOAD_REVIEWS
        ADD_NEW_REVIEW

        BUY

        LOGIN

        REQUEST_BEGIN
        REQUEST_SUCCESS

        XXXX_ERROR

step-3: define pure-function/reducers to make new-state based on action      
        - itemsReducer
        - reviewsReducer
        - cartReducer
        ....

step-4 : combine/compose all reducers as rootReducer

step-5 : create single-store with rootReducer + intial state
